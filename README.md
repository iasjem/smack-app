# Smack App (Clone chat for Slack) 

* This project is based on a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/) as part of my journey in learning how to code in Swift.
* The lesson covers various topics including handling APIs and using Cocoa libraries such as Alamofire, SwiftyJSON and Socket IO.
* I do not own any of the assets for this app and only serves as self-study.
